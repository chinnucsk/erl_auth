To use, configure url in backend.py, set as the AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND

(this monkey patches django's login and logout functions, so needs to appear
before django.contrib.auth or anything that uses it in INSTALLED_APPS), 
and add to INSTALLED_APPS

The above isn't necessary unless you need to get into the admin.

A PROJECT_NAME can be added to settings which becomes "application" in the
erl_auth sessions and auth.

Changes to Users in admin will not reflect in the auth server. The auth server
profile always takes precedence over django profiles. There are plans to change
this to sync with saving users in django.

request.user is now a proxy class around the profile returned from the auth
server. Any fields not present in the profile will cause a django user
to get pulled/created for the profile, and the field pulled from it instead.

login, logout, authenticate, etc, are all moved now into auth and the proxy
model.
