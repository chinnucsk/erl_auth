erl_auth is an authentication library intended for use with web services
It provides a REST interface via webmachine (http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/wiki/Home)
and will eventually provide clients for Django and phpbb

My goal for this project is to eventually offer a full single sign on offering
with domain locality. Currently, users are domain agnostic, and sessions
are separated based on an application name.

The webmachine is located in web/

Clients are in clients/

Implementations will be separated from clients after creation
